			<td class="d1"><p>Since they are very outgoing and energetic, you have to walk them and play with them a lot, so that they are able to stay in shape and healthy through out their long lives, and so that they aren't bored.</p></td>

			<td class="d1"><p>Just like every other dog, golden retrivers are omnivores they are able to eat both meat and plants. Noteable meat and plants that I fed my golden retriver are beef, chicken, lamb and some on the plant side, pumpkin, pea, cooked potatoes, and broccoli.</p></td>
